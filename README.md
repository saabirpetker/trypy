Just a bit of fun. Mini tutorials to learn how to visualise things with graphs in python. Useful for any aspiring data-handling (real) scientist.

Have been using python for years to visualise data. Matplotlib is a familiar friend now. Enjoy the first tutorial, **supersimplebook**

Did a brute force graphing problem for a mini project in a short timespan but realised I could've done it faster, thus inspiring our second tutorial, **plotcsv**

Saw Excel have a new python integration - worth trying some of that out too. Checkout **Excelpy** - yeah don't do that just yet...

This python tutorial requires you to have the neccessary packages installed...
We'll try and keep this up to date, so just make sure you have anaconda installed and you'll be okay. (Just follow online instructions on downloading anaconda for your machine. https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/ )

Once you've got anaconda, open jupyter notebooks, navigate to a folder you want to work in, and download the tutorials there. https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/github-download#:~:text=To%20download%20a%20folder%20from%20GitHub%2C%20navigate%20to%20your%20desired,text%20box%2C%20and%20hit%20enter%20.

When you are actually coding yourself, I would recommend using Visual Studio Code but you can stick with Jupyter Notebooks - I've only recently moved across.
