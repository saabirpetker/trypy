Just a bit of fun. Mini tutorials to learn how to graph things in python. Useful for any aspiring data-handling (real) scientist.
Did a brute force graphing problem for a mini project in a short timespan but realised I could've done it faster, thus inspiring our first tutorial, **plotcsv**

#**Read Before Starting**
This python tutorial requires you to have the neccessary packages installed...
We'll try and keep this up to date, so just make sure you have anaconda installed and you'll be okay. (Just follow online instructions on downloading anaconda for your machine.
Once you've got anaconda, open jupyter notebooks and load the tutorials there.
When you are actuall doing coding yourself, I would recommend using Visual Studio Code but you can stick with Jupyter Notebooks - I've only recently moved across.
Once done, then work through the simple plotting tutorial first, then move on to plotcsv.
